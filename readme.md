In this repository I will presnent my PCB designes. 
My first project is custom LED controller based on the Arduino Nano that i have designed and manufaktured with JLCPCB. More on that in the PCB_designe/LED_arduino_controller.
The second project is stepper motor controller based on  E-L298N chip that i have designed for my PCB desgine cource at my university.
