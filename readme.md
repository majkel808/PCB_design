In this repository I will presnent my PCB designs. 

My **main** project is custom **LED controller** based on the Arduino Nano that i have designed and manufactured with JLCPCB. More on that in the **PCB_design/LED_arduino_controller**.

The second project is stepper motor controller based on  E-L298N chip that i have designed for my PCB desgine course at my university.
