# LED Arduino Nano Controller PCB designe 

## Project description

To gain a better understanding of the PCB design process, I wanted to design my own custom LED controller board for the wall-mounted Neon Light of my designe. The goal was to create my own PCB in CiruitMaker and later to manufactured it with JLCPCB. It was a test how fast can I create custom boards, for my future robotics projects.
