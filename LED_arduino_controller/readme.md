# LED Arduino Nano Controller PCB Design

## Project Description

To gain a better understanding of the PCB design process, I wanted to design my own custom LED controller board for the wall-mounted Neon Light of my design. The goal was to create my own PCB in CircuitMaker and later to manufacture it with JLCPCB. It was a test of how fast I could create custom boards for my future robotics projects.

## Functionality Description
The aim of the project was to control a custom Neon Light, which has two different ARGB LED strips. The user should be able to control:
- The brightness of the LED with a potentiometer
- The range of each component of the RGB color via a potentiometer
- Choose which LED strip is controlled with a bistable switch
- Powering on the device with a button

Due to differences in required voltage and high power consumption of the LED strips, three step-down converters were used in the project.

## Electronic Schematic

The schematic was made in CircuitMaker. Due to the lack of components in the program's library, it was necessary to create custom electronic parts.

### The electronic schematic:

## Electronics Testing

When the schematic was ready, I tested the electronic components and the whole wiring configuration on a breadboard. With this setup, it was possible to write an Arduino sketch to control the LED strip.

## Arduino IDE Coding

The Arduino code I prepared for this project was divided into three files:
- NEON_arduino_two_strip.ino for defining the libraries and used variables. I used the FastLED.h library for easy control of ARGB LEDs.
- b_Setup.ino for the configuration of the Arduino and the void setup() function
- c_loop.ino for reading the input values from switches, potentiometers, and for controlling the LED strips.

## PCB Design

I used the already known to me software CircuitMaker (free software from Altium) to design my own PCB. I precisely adjusted the component placement and traces to enable single-sided PCB printing. I also considered the trace width for high-current loops.

## PCB Manufacturing

I used the JLCPCB website to manufacture my PCB board. I mounted the PCB with soldered components in a 3D-printed enclosure. The PCB and the finished board are presented below.
