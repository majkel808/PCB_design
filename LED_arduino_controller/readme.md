# LED Arduino Nano Controller PCB designe 

## Project description

To gain a better understanding of the PCB design process, I wanted to design my own custom LED controller board for the wall-mounted Neon Light of my designe. The goal was to create my own PCB in CiruitMaker and later to manufactured it with JLCPCB. It was a test how fast can I create custom boards, for my future robotics projects.

## Functionality Description
The aim of the project was to control custom Neon Ligt, that have two different ARGB LED strips. The user should be able to control:
- The brightness of the LED with potentiometer
- Range of each component of the RGB color via potentiometer
- Choose which LED strip is contolled with bistable switch 
- Powering on the device with a button

Due to diffrence in required volatge and huge power consumtion of the LED stips, 3 steps down converters were used in the project.


## Electronic Schematic

The schematic was made in CircuitMaker, due to the lack of components in the program's library, it was necessary to create custom electronic parts.

### The electronic schematic:

## Electronics Testing

When the schematic was ready, I've tested the electronic components and whole wiring configuration on the bradboard. With this setup it was possible to write an arduino sketch to controll the LED strip.

## Arduino IDE Coding

The arduino code I have preapeard for this project was devided in 3 files
- NEON_arduino_two_strip.ino for defining the libraries, used variables. I have used the FastLED.h library for easy control of ARGB LED's.
- b_Setup.ino for the configuration of the arduino nad the void setup() function
- c_loop.ino for readiing the input values form swtiches potentiometer, and for controlling the LED strips.

## PCB Design

I've used the already known to me software CircuitMaker (free software from Altium) to designe my own PCB. I precisely adjusted the component placement and traces to enable single-sided PCB printing. I also considered the trace width for high-current loops.

## PCB Manufacturing

I've used the JLCPCB website to manufature my PCB
