# E-L298N Stepper Motor Driver PCB Design 

## Project Description

While working on a PCB design project at my university, I designed the PCB boards based on known documentation. The main chip of the stepper motor driver was the E-L298N.

## Electronic Schematic

The schematic was made in CircuitMaker from Altium. Most of the components were available in the CircuitMaker libraries.

## PCB Design

I used the already known to me software CircuitMaker to design my own PCB. The board was designed for 2-layer manufacturing. I also considered the trace width for high-current loops.
